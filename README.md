All this projects are un-finished and they are not even half of the projects and activities that we have done during the two years of the course (2021-2023).
It should be noted that although four of these projects/activities are done in Flutter, the majority of the course was focused on programming with C# and using Microsoft SQL Server in the .NET framework using Visual Studio and not on the development of mobile applications with Flutter.
